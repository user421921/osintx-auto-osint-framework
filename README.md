# osintx-auto-osint-framework
This is a repository for 2 tools (a linux and win version) of a tool I originally therorized to take vars and then start public record search engines in your browser to compare and read the online data of peoples names, phone numbers, emails, icense plates, and VINs. keep in mind the origional version was in batch and then I translated it over to shellscript so tell me if you run into problems with the linux one and what distro and version you are using. Also I am not responsible for what you use this tool for. this is a us based tool so if you put foreign info into it, it may bug out
